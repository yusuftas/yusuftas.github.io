It has always started with a "Hello world!".

Babies are born and they are told "Hello world!". Everyone who starts learning coding tries to print "Hello world!" before even understanding any programming. And here I am, starting my first post in my new blog with a "Hello world!".

There is a saying that "Ignorance is bliss". But not all the time. Out of my ignorance I lost my old blog. To be honest, I was not expecting that domain hunters would pick my website and try to sell it back to me for more than $1000 and so I ignored. Ignorance was a bliss until I realized I lost my domain. So here we are, with a new domain.

This blog will be a fresh start for me, returning back to learning and sharing so that people can utilize and develop their skills. I have been quite busy with my Phd. and other things and I realized I haven't been learning new exciting things for quite some time. So it is time to go back to my old self and start learning and publishing again.

**What will this blog be about ?** Anything I find exciting and worth publishing. **What will this blog not be about ?** Anything related to my Phd., I'm having enough of them everyday :)

This doesn't mean I will not post anything related to deep learning. This means that I will not post any deep learning related stuff which is in my Phd. So don't worry, there will be lots of deep learning, I still love all the things in Machine Learning and Computer Vision that is not in my Phd.

That is enough idle talk for now, it is time to work. I don't know who is reading this now; but you should expect more to come ;)
